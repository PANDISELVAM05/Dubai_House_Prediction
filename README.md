# Dubai House Prediction

# Project Overview

The Dubai House Price Prediction project aims to analyze and visualize the real estate market in Dubai using data analytics techniques.
This project focuses on understanding rental price patterns across different locations, property types, and categories, using Kaggle datasets for real-time analysis.

The complete workflow includes Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Data Visualization.

# Project Workflow
# Data Collection

The dataset was collected from Kaggle real estate listings related to Dubai house rent and sale data.

It contains features like:

Location

City

Type of Property (Apartment, Villa, etc.)

Number of Beds

Rent Amount

Rent Category (High, Medium, Low)

Goal: Build a foundation for predicting and analyzing rental price patterns across Dubai.

# Data Cleaning

Removed duplicate and missing records.

Handled incorrect or inconsistent values.

Converted datatypes for numeric and categorical features.

Ensured uniform data formatting for accurate analysis.

Libraries used: pandas, numpy

# Data Transformation

Performed feature encoding and normalization.

Created new calculated fields such as Total Rent, Average Rent by Type, and Rent Category Percentage.

Prepared the dataset for visualization and further analysis.

Tools used: pandas, sklearn.preprocessing

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducted statistical analysis to understand variable distributions.

Discovered relationships between number of beds, property type, and rental prices.

Identified top-performing cities and premium locations for rent.

Techniques: Correlation matrix, descriptive statistics, trend analysis.

# Data Visualization

Designed an interactive dashboard to visualize Dubai housing trends.

Visualization tools used: Power BI and Python (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly).

Key visualizations include:

  Sum of Rent by City and Type (Treemap)
  
  Sum of Rent by Beds (Line Chart)
  
  Sum of Rent by Location (Bar Chart)
  
  Sum of Rent by Type (Bar Chart)
  
  Sum of Rent by Rent Category (Pie Chart)

# Tools & Technologies Used

Python → pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

Power BI → for dashboard creation

Kaggle → dataset source

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook → data processing and visualization

# Key Insights

Dubai and Abu Dhabi have the highest rent sums.

Apartments dominate the market, followed by Villas.

High Rent Category covers nearly 68% of the total listings.

Rent increases with bed count up to a certain limit, showing market affordability trends.

# Outcome

Created a complete end-to-end analytics pipeline for Dubai house rent prediction.

Improved hands-on skills in data cleaning, transformation, and dashboarding.

Learned to interpret real-time datasets effectively for business insights.

# Future Scope

Implement Machine Learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to predict future rental prices.

Automate dashboard updates with new data streams.

Integrate web-based analytics dashboard for user interaction.
